<h1>Perform a Query with Splunk</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough of the Perform a Query with Splunk activity from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification course on Coursera. 
</br></br>
During this lab I will run basic queries on data to answer a series of related questions. For the queries, I will use tools such as the pipe and wildcard characters to refine the results as needed.

<h2>Programs and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Splunk Cloud Platform</b>

<h2>Going through the Lab</h2>

<p align="center">Before the actual use of Splunk the lab required that some sample data be uploaded using the 'Add Data' function. The sample data is provided by Google through a download in the Coursera activity and that data is where the query is pulling information from.</p></br>
